import libraries and read the data

data exploration
-% of missing values
-plot the explorations
-correlations(heatmap)

feature engineering

train test split

build ML models for cross val
-check cross val score and select best model
-check/plot feature importance
-remove low-score feature(score didnt improve on removing)

fit the model

print all performance metrics before tuning

hyperparameter tuning using grid search
-fit the model with best params

print all performance metrics after tuning
